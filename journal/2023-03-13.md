### Phoenix
* Request flow
  * Endpoint - Converts the request into a `conn` and applies policies that are common to all requests
  * Router - Applies policies to the `conn` based on the type of request and delegates further processing of the conn to the controller
      * `get "/count", CounterController, :index` where
        * `get` is request type
        * `"/count"` is the path
        * `CounterController` is the module to direct to
        * `:index` is the function to call
  * Controller - 
  * View - 
  * Template - 
    * Uses the `@assign_name` to render the assigns
    * Can use `assigns.assign_name` to optionally render a an assigns value that may not be defined
