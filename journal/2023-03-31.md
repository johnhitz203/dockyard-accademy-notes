## Questions
* I said in class that the request first goes to a controller that renders a traditional dead view w/ javascript that sets up a persistent channel, the rerenders as a liveview. But, in your example there are no traditional [CRUD] routes. 
  * How/where/when is the initial render done?

[[live_view]]
