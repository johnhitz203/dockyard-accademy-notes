[[Strings and Binaries]]

How do Hex codes relate to colors? Are the codes just a list of Hex numbers associated with the RGB codes? And/or, is there a conversion function or something?

[[Regex]]

regex.com to try out regular expressions as you write them?

Is there a way to test regex? Ie, is there a testing library or can we use ExUnit or something else?

## Regex Strategy
Use multiple line with comments relating to every part of
the string. This requires that the Regex sigil is followed
by the letter "x".

```
~r/regex/
```
vs
```elixir
~r/
   r            #  r
   e            #  e
   g            #  g
   e            #  e
   x            #  x
 /x
 ```
