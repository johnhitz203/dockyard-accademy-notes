## Guards

- Prevents incorrect data from being passed into a function

## With
- Provides a series of preconditions
- Returns value of the failing preconditions
- Can be used with `else`
- Validations can be nested or not

### Nested
```elixir
with %{team1_name: _, team2_name: _} <- game,
     %{round1: %{team1: _, team2: _}, round2: %%{team1: _, team2: _}, round3: %%{team1: _, team2: _}} <- game do
  "Success"
else
  error -> {:error, :invalid}
end
```

### Not Nested
```elixir
with %{team1_name: _, team2_name: _} <- game,
     %{round1: round1, round2: round2, round3: round3} <- game,
     %{team1: _, team2: _} <- round1,
     %{team1: _, team2: _} <- round2,
     %{team1: _, team2: _} <- round3 do
  "Success"
else
  error -> {:error, :invalid}
end
```

## Types of Control Flow

### Comb vs Tree Control Flow

## Pattern Matching with Structs

- A struct will pattern match on a map
  
```elixir
iex> %{name: "name} = %{name: "bob"}
iex> name
iex> bob
```

- struct will not pattern match with a map 
```elixir
iex %User{name: "name} = %{name: "bob"}
iex> No match on left hand side
```
