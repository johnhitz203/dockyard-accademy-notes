## Enumerations
[[Reduce]] - Every thing is reduce

### Tools To Use With Reduce
Map.put - Used to build up a [[Map]] in the accumulator.

## Problem Solving
1. Write the problem statement and update it as more understanding is reached
2. Think about inputs and outputs
2.2 What are the data structures, do they have modules in elixir, and/or what module can you use to compute on them?
3. If data has physical shape(s) draw and label 
-- If data is talked about in more than one physical shape draw and label all representations
1. Update a few cells in the data representations by # 

### Example:

Problem: Create a Tic Tac Toe game using a 3 x 3 gid as the playing board. Access the positions on the board with an {x, y} coordinate
Inputs: board is a list of 3 list, each w/ 3 indices

| grid                | coordinates                     | list w/ indices |
| :---:               | :---:                           | :---:
|  board = [          | board = [                       |  board = [ 
|    ["X", "O", nil], |   [{0, 2}, {1, 2}, {2, 2}],     |   i0, [i0=(0,0), i1=(1, 0), i2=(2,0)]  => 2 - 0
| How do we convert a grid to a list of list? |
|    [nil, "X", "O"], |   [{0, 1}, {1, 1}, {2, 1}],     |   i1, 
|    [nil, nil, "X"]  |   [{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {2, 0}]      |   i2  


Modules in elixir coralate w/ data types

| data type | tool |
| :---      | :--  |
| string    |
