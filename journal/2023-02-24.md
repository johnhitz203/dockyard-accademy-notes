### Persistence

<ins>File Module</ins>
  Allows code to read/right from/to files on the file system

- File.cd/1 change directory
- File.dir?/2 chick if file is directory
- File.exists?/2 check if file exists
- File.ls/1 list all files and folders in current directory()
- File.read/1 read file content
- File.rm/1 remove a file
- File.rm_rf/1 remove files and directories in a given path
- File.mkdir/1 - given a path, crate a directory
- File.mkdir_p/1 given a path, create a directory and all parent directories 
- File.write/3 write content to a given file path.

<ins>Path Module</ins>
Has functions for manipulating file paths on disk

- Path.absname/1 convert the given path into an absolute path
- Path.dirname/1 return the directory portion of a given path
- Path.join/2 join two paths (superior reliability to string concatenation)
- Path.split/1 split path int a list on each directory separator
- Path.wildcard/2 return a list of files that match the provided expression

<ins>Bang Functions</ins>
Raise and error if they fail. Non-bang functions typically return {:error, :enoent}

- User bang version (eg File.ls!/1) if it is expected the function will always succeed

<ins>Persisting Erlang Terms</ins>
File.write/2 fails with `:badarg` if we give it a non-string argument

- :erlang.binary_to_term/1 - converts a binary to an elixir term
- :erlang.binary_to_term

<ins>Handling Large Files</ins>
Loading large files into memory can cause performance issues.

- File.stream!/3 - returns the file contents as a stream
- File.open/3 and File.close/1 can alternatively be used with the `IO` module to open, read/write content and close a file

<ins>Streams</ins>
By default each line in the file will be one element in the stream

<ins>IO and the File System</ins>
IO allow reading and writing from/to an open file

- IO.read/2 reads a new line for each successive call
- IO.write/2 over writes the entire file on each call
- File.open/3 requires the `:write` option to enable the file to have write permission
