[[Ecto]]
## Gaurds Review
* Two main uses
  * Used in multiple function heads to:
    * Validate input
    * Achieve polymorphism

## Examples
  ```elixir
  defmodule PolymorphismWGuards do
    def double(num) when is_number(num) do
      num * 2
    end

    def double(string) when is_bitstring(string) do
      string <> string
    end
  end
  ```

  ```elixir
  defmodule ValidationWGuards do
    defguard is_guess(guess) when guess in [:rock, :paper, :scissor]

    def winner(guess) when is_guess(guess) do
      case guess do
        :rock -> 
        :paper -> 
        :scissors ->
      end
    end
  ```

  ## Ecto One-to-Many Associations
  * In a one-to-many relationship a single record from one table is associated with many records from another table
  * Associations are created with a foreign key relationship
  * Ecto uses the `has` keyword to create Associations
  * SQL creates an association with a parent_id field on the child
  ```elixir
  defmodule MyModule do
    ...
    schema "parent" do
      ...
      has_one
    end
  end

  defmodule MyMigration do
    ...

    def change do
      ...
      create constraint(:authors,:birthdate, check: "birth_date < CURRENT_DATE"
      end
    end
  end
```
* Advantages and Disadvantages
  * Database constraints are more reliable
    * Data may be coming from unknown sources that don't have the same constraints as our app
  * Application constraints are more useful in term of our application
    * ie better user errors

## Using mix Generators

```
  iex> mix phx.gen.html \ 
  Books Book books \ 
  title:string author_id:references:authors
```
* `has_many` - Map an parent association with child record
* `belongs_to` - Map a child association with a parent record

## Seeding Data
* Can have individual seed files to put data in database for specific purposes
  * have data with different length strings to see how they look on different layout
  * add users of different types
