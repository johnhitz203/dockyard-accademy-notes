## Review
`{:ok, author} = BookSearch.Authors.create_author(%{name: "John Hitz", birth_date: ~D[1966-08-19]})`

* `build_assoc` - Creates the the associated data structure for two resources
* `put_assoc` - Puts the association into the changeset
* `build_assoc` and `put_assoc` - Essentially do the same thing
  * `build_assoc` - starts with an author and crates a book that is associated with the author
  * `put_assoc` - (???) Starts with an book and associates it with the author

### Phoenix Forms
* Can create a new book for an author from a form or from url params
