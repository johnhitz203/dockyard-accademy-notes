## Things I Learned Today
Problem Solving:
### Inputs, Transformations, and Outputs
<ins>Inputs:</ins>
Think about what form the data is in.
  1. Is it in a form that can be processed in Elixir?
  2. Can it be put in to a form that increases ease of processing?
  3. does it need to be ordered (ie would lists be best), would it help to put it into a single structure (ie a tuple or a map)?
  4. What module(s) are there to work with the data in either the current form or a form that it can be represented with?

<ins>Transformations</ins>
  1. Does data need to be removed as it is processed?
  2. Does each value in the data need to be updated or does the data need to be reduced into a single value?
  3. Does data need to be changed from one data structure to another?
   
<ins>Outputs</ins>
  1. What structure does the data need to be returned in?
  2. What Module can most easily achieve desired output?
