### Positioning
* Static - Default position
* Relative - sets the position relative to where it normally would be if it was statically positioned. Relative position takes the element out of the document flow and moves it by the specified value.
* Absolute - Removes the element from the document flow. Allows the element to be positioned in a specific place without concern for the elements around it.
  * Absolute allows an element to be placed at an absolute position within some parent element
  * Requires the parent element to be positioned with `relative`, `absolute`, `sticky`, or ` fixed`
* Fixed - Similar to absolute with some caveats. `Fixed` positioning is fixed in relation to the entire html viewport.
  * Viewport -
* Sticky - Combination of `relative` and `fixed` position into one

### Flex and Grid
