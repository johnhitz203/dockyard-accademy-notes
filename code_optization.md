## Code Optimization

### Libraries & Tools
* flame_on - Adds flame graphs to your Phoenix Application or LiveDashboard that profiles where your functions are being executed and where they have bottle necks
  
### Technique
1. Look at how others have solved the problem
2. Follow idiomatic patterns
3. Lean into concurrency 
4. Shallow copy - Larger data structures are not "deep" copied (ie a tuple in a list can have a reference vs being copied into the new data structure)
