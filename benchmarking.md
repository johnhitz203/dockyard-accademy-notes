## Benchmarking

### Use case
* Identify bottleneck in system
  * time
  * memory usage - How much data is being stored while running the program
  * number of database calls
  * number of operations/repetition of work
  * change in performance as data grows
* Identify limited accessability
* Identify bottleneck in page load speed and seo
* Benchmark search - are you searching in memory or in the db
  * How time footprint changes with more data stored in db
  * 

### Tools & Techniques
* chrome lighthouse - page load / seo 
* chrome axe - accessability
* Benchee 
* Use time stamps
* timer.tc - call an anonymous function that returns elapsed time in microseconds
* Big O notation - measure how many calculations need to be done give a data set
  * linier
  * exponential 
  * logarithmic

### Strategies
* Use different data sets to evaluate how results change over time
* Use data that is representative of the use case
